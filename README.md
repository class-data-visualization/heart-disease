     - High accuracy and robustness to overfitting.
     - Reliable performance across diverse datasets.

2. **XGBoost Classifier**
   - **Hyperparameters**:
     - Column Sample by Tree: 0.8
     - Gamma: 2
     - Learning Rate: 0.1
     - Maximum Depth: 3
     - Number of Estimators: 50
     - Subsample Ratio: 1.0
   - **Test Accuracy**: 86%
   - **Strengths**:
     - Superior ability to capture complex relationships in the data.
     - Slightly higher accuracy compared to Random Forest.

#### Comparative Analysis
- **Random Forest** is an excellent choice for scenarios where **robustness and resistance to overfitting** are critical. Its ensemble approach ensures stable performance, making it a reliable model for general-purpose classification tasks.
- **XGBoost** outperforms Random Forest in terms of **accuracy** due to its ability to model intricate patterns and interactions within the data. It is particularly effective when dealing with datasets that have complex, non-linear relationships.

#### Recommendations
- **Use Random Forest** when:
  - Interpretability and robustness are prioritized.
  - The dataset is relatively small or prone to overfitting.
- **Use XGBoost** when:
  - Maximizing accuracy is the primary goal.
  - The dataset is large and contains complex patterns.

#### Conclusion
Both models demonstrated strong performance in the classification task, with XGBoost achieving a slightly higher accuracy. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for robustness (Random Forest) or the ability to capture complex relationships (XGBoost). This analysis provides actionable insights for selecting the most suitable model for future applications.
